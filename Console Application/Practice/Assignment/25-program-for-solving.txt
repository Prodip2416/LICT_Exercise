
Programs:
 
1.find the immediate next prime number
 for eg: input:9
            output:11
            hint was given: input will not exceed 100
 
2.find the number of even numbers repeating
for eg: input:{2,2,3,3,4,4}
           output:2
          check for this input also ....output for {8,8,4,4,4,2,5,5} is 2
          even numbers 8 and 4 are repeating.. so output is 2
 
4.input ll be a number
  find the product of odd digits and even digits seperately
  sum the products
  if all the digits are odd or even add 1 to the sum 
  

8. write a program to print second largest divisor of the given number
   eg:input=21  divisors are {1,3,7,21}
   output=7
9.write a program  to find factorial of individual digits in a given input number and store it in an array
  eg:123
  output={1,4,9}
10.swap to print only non intersecting elements from the two given arrays. size of both input arrays is equal.
  eg:input1={1,2,3,4,5}
     input2={2,3,6,7,8}
     output={1,4,5,6,7,8}
 
11.write a program to print the elements in first array which is not present in second array.size of both input arrays is equal.
  eg:input1={11,12,13,14,15}
     input2={11,13,2,3,4}
     output={12,14,15}

12. write a armstrong program  between two ranges and find largest one in that.


13.write a program for delete  -ve elemts in array and sum positive ones
  br: store -2 if all r -ve elemts,store -1 if size -ve

14.Add multiples of "input1" till input2 and store in output1
input1=3
input2=15
output1=45
15.input1={12365,12396,12125,12256}
input2=4(arraysize)
input3=123(find this pattern in array and print next numbers in output array)
output1={65,96}
br:input1[i]<0 op=-1
input2<0  op=-2
16.sort array1 in ascd order,  array2 in desc order. Multipy 1st elmt in arr1 with last elmt in arr2  and so on. (criscross multiplication) and store in output1 array.
17.extract the even digit
 for eg: input:4512
         output:42
         input:1315
         ouput:0
18.find the diff between consecutive elements in array . assign the largest difference to the output
   eg: ip={4,10,6,5,3}
       op=6;(store the difference between consecutive elements in a seperate array)
19.     Smallest of four digits.
